                This app is specifically built for use wherever you want to be able to display the social media reach of your brand without the clutter of a typical Twitter® client. It displays results full screen at 1024x768 with no navigation bar or control bars for an elegant and clean look, and with a iPad to HDMI or VGA adapter can be sent to any video projector or external monitor(s) that your iDevice supports. Check your iDevice's documentation for information on its output resolution.
                </p>
                <p>
                This app does not send Tweets, log in to a Twitter account, or update a Twitter® feed. It is not a Twitter® client, nor is it configured to "follow", "re-tweet" or perform any other functions associated with Twitter®.

                    <li style="padding:30px;">The "HELP" button brings up a list of frequently asked questions and topics.</li>
                    <li style="padding:30px;">The "SETTINGS" button opens a dialog box that allows you to save your current configurations.</li>
                    <li style="padding:30px;">The "HIDE" button minimizes the configuration interface and hides the top navigation.</li>

                    <li style="padding:30px;">CHANGE COLOR:<br>
                        Use the "color wheel" to change your background and font colors. Click "Font Color" to begin applying "color wheel" styles to the fonts, and click "Background Color" to begin applying "color wheel" styles to the background color. By default the background color is selected.

                    <li style="padding:30px;">
                        ADD BACKGROUND IMAGE:<br>
                        Click the "upload logo" button and browse the Photo Gallery for your iDevice. CineTweet will automatically position the image in the center of the display. The recommended image dimensions are 1024 pixels wide and 728 pixels high, saved as a .PNG, .JPG, or .GIF. Taking a picture with your mobile device may produce an image that is too big or the wrong format for CineTweet to import correctly. In addition, if your image has a transparent background (such as a .GIF or a .PNG) it may not display correctly due to the way iOS re-compresses images on import.

                    <li style="padding:30px;">

                    <li style="padding:30px;">
